To run this hand gesture recognition code on your laptop, follow these steps for the initial setup:

1. Install Python (If Not Installed)
Make sure Python (preferably 3.7+) is installed on your laptop.
Check the version:

python --version
If not installed, download it from: Python Official Website

2. Install Required Libraries
Your code uses OpenCV, cvzone, and pyFirmata. Install them using:

pip install opencv-python
pip install cvzone
pip install pyfirmata2
If you face issues, try:

pip install opencv-python-headless
3. Install MediaPipe (For Hand Tracking)
Since cvzone uses MediaPipe for hand tracking, install it:

pip install mediapipe
4. Setup Arduino (If Using LED Control)
If you're using an Arduino board to control LEDs, install the pyFirmata library:

pip install pyfirmata2
Connect your Arduino to the laptop via USB.
Find your COM port (Windows: Device Manager → Ports).
In controller.py, update:

comport = 'COM10'  # Change it to your correct COM port
5. Run the Code
Execute the Python script:

python your_script.py
If the camera doesn't start, check:

Your webcam permissions.
Change the camera index in the code:

video = cv2.VideoCapture(1)  # If laptop has multiple cameras
6. Troubleshooting
If "No module named cvzone", reinstall:

pip install --upgrade cvzone
If the camera doesn’t open, ensure it's not being used by another app.
